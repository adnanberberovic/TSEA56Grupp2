# TSEA56Grupp2 - Charting robot
This repository contains the source code for a functioning charting and rescue robot.
It has the capability to chart a 6x6m maze consisting of 40x40cm tiles according to a specific set of rules set for the maze (document is in swedish).
This was a project done by a group of 6 students at Link√∂ping University, as part of our bachelor degree.
Most of the code is not in the best of shapes, but nontheless it works for it's intended purpose.
